# ERCF-Pregate-Sensors

This mod adds pregate sensors to the ERCF V2 that are incorporated right into the filament path parts.

There are also nifty little mounts to hold an XH 2 pin board connector below the gate to help aid in quick removal of the filament path if maintenance is needed.

There are 4 parts involved with this mod and each need to be printed for each gate. I recommend daisy chaining the GND connector between each XH under the ERCF to save space for the number of wires run in the channel. This was tested with a 5 gate ERCF, fitting more wires in the channel than that may not be possible, YMMV.

All parts are oriented as they should be printed and supports are built into the parts where needed.
